- What is a session? graph?
- What are tensors?
- What are variables? constants? placeholders? How do you use them?
- What are operations? How do you use them?
- What are namespaces? How do you use them?
- How to train a neural network in tensorflow
- What is a checkpoint?
- How to save/load a model with tensorflow
- What is the graph collection?
- How to add and get variables from the collection
