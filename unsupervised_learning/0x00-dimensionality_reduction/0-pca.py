    Function that performs PCA on a dataset

    Arguments:
     - X is a numpy.ndarray of shape (n, d) where:
        * n is the number of data points

        all dimensions have a mean of 0 across all data points

     The weights matrix, W, that maintains var fraction
     of Xâ€˜s original variance
      - W is a numpy.ndarray of shape (d, nd) where nd is the
        new dimensionality of the transformed X
