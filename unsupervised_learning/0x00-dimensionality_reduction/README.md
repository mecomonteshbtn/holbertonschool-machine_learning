### [0. Likelihood](./0-likelihood.py)
You are conducting a study on a revolutionary cancer drug and are looking to find the probability that a patient who takes this drug will develop severe side effects. During your trials, `n` patients take the drug and `x` patients develop severe side effects. You can assume that `x` follows a binomial distribution.

Write a function `def likelihood(x, n, P):` that calculates the likelihood of obtaining this data given various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects:
*   `x` is the number of patients that develop severe side effects
*   `n` is the total number of patients observed
*   `P` is a 1D `numpy.ndarray` containing the various hypothetical probabilities of developing severe side effects
*   If `n` is not a positive integer, raise a `ValueError` with the message `n must be a positive integer`
*   If `x` is not an integer that is greater than or equal to `0`, raise a `ValueError` with the message `x must be an integer that is greater than or equal to 0`
*   If `x` is greater than `n`, raise a `ValueError` with the message `x cannot be greater than n`
*   If `P` is not a 1D `numpy.ndarray`, raise a `TypeError` with the message `P must be a 1D numpy.ndarray`
*   If any value in `P` is not in the range `[0, 1]`, raise a `ValueError` with the message `All values in P must be in the range [0, 1]`
*   Returns: a 1D `numpy.ndarray` containing the likelihood of obtaining the data, `x` and `n`, for each probability in `P`, respectively

Awesome! We can see pretty good clusters! For comparison, hereâ€™s how PCA performs on the same dataset:

alexa@ubuntu-xenial:0x00-dimensionality_reduction$ cat pca.py 
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
pca = __import__('1-pca').pca

X = np.loadtxt("mnist2500_X.txt")
labels = np.loadtxt("mnist2500_labels.txt")
Y = pca(X, 2)
plt.scatter(Y[:, 0], Y[:, 1], 20, labels)
plt.colorbar()
plt.title('PCA')
plt.show()
alexa@ubuntu-xenial:0x00-dimensionality_reduction$ ./pca.py 
```
