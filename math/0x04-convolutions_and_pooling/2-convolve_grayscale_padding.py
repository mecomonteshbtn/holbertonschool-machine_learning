    Fucntion that performs a convolution on grayscale images
    with custom padding

    Arguments:
     - images is a numpy.ndarray with shape (m, h, w) containing
        multiple grayscale images
        * m is the number of images
        * h is the height in pixels of the images
        * w is the width in pixels of the images
     - kernel is a numpy.ndarray with shape (kh, kw) containing the kernel
        for the convolution
        * kh is the height of the kernel
        * kw is the width of the kernel
     - padding is a tuple of (ph, pw)
        * ph is the padding for the height of the image
        * pw is the padding for the width of the image
        the image should be padded with 0â€™s
